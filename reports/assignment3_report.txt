FUTURE_EXCLUSIVE

1. The pid field of the future is used to save the process pid which is waiting for the future value. 
2. Whenever a process tries to get the value of the future, a future can be in 3 possible states
  -> EMPTY- when in empty state the process pid is saved in the future and suspend() is called for that process
  -> WAITING - waiting state means some other process is already waiting on this future . Thus it returns error.
  -> READY - the future value is already available and this value is returned.
  
3. The process setting the future value gets the pid from the futures sets the future value and resumes the pid which is present in the future.
4. If there is no waiting pid the future simply write the value and change the state to ready.
5. Mulitple writes to the same future return error unless another process is wating for the value.


FUTURE_SHARED

1. In order to achive one(writer) to many(readers) relationship, a custom queue is used to capture all the reader processes. This queue is implemented using LinkedList.
2. When the process tries to get the future value if the state is 
   ->EMPTY or WAITING - change the state to waiting and push process id to the get queue and suspend the process.
   -> READY - if the value has already been written then the the future value is returned.
3. When the process tries to set the future value if the future state is
  -> EMPTY - the value is set to the future's value and the state is changed t0 READY
  -> WAITING - the value is set and each process in the queue is poped and resumed.
  -> READY - multiple calls to set returns ERROR.


FUTURE_QUEUE

1. In order to achive many(readers) to many(writers) relationship, two custom queues are created, one for the processes that sets the value and other for the process that fetches the value.
2. When a process tries to get the value if the state of future is
  ->EMPTY or WAITING - push the process id into the queue and suspend the process.
  ->READY - first it checks if the set queue is empty if so it reads the value from the future and returns it.
	     Otherwise it pushes itself to the get_queue and pops the process from the top of the set queue and resumes it setting the future's state to WAITING.
	    Meanwhile the current process suspends its excution waiting for the resumed process to set the value. 
3. When a process tries to set the value if the state of the future is
  ->EMPTY or Ready- push the process id setting the queue to the end of the queue.
  ->WAITING- set the value to the future's value, set the state to READY and pop the process from the front of the queue and resume that process.
